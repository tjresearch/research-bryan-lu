Find the ratio fracAB cdot CDAC cdot BD, and prove that the circumcircles of the triangles ACD and BCD are orthogonal. (Intersecting circles are said to be orthogonal if at either common point their tangents are perpendicuar. Thus, proving that the circumcircles of the triangles ACD and BCD are orthogonal is equivalent to proving that the tangents to the circumcircles of the triangles ACD and BCD at the point C are perpendicular.)
