Hi Dr. White! 

I did end up doing a little bit of research work this week, but I lost track of time and I didn't actually realize how close to the end we are. That being said, I'm starting to try to figure out how to best prepare this in github form so that people don't have to do as much grunt work themselves to get this thing to run. I'm starting to draft some explanations based in my personal comments in random places in text files/code and I'll probably start putting those instructions on my github page. 

I did end up doing some I/O stuff for my project and start trying to feed it my own annotations, but I don't really have much progress/many things to say. I will say I did do a lot of self-indulging in like non-CS/physics related escapades that took up a lot of my time this week (oops) and I hopefully am going to be more productive next week for this class. 

I also committed to college this week! I will probably be attending Cornell University (Arts and Sciences) next year, provided I don't get off any waitlists or anything. Honestly, I'm not super sure I made the right call, but I do think I'm going to like it there because I think the flexibility and diversity of options will make it really easy to make my own way. :)
