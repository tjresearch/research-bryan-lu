Hi Dr. White! 

I didn't end up doing a lot of research work -- aside from spending a lot of time (a full day or two) writing up probability theory notes, I had to sit in on a couple of somewhat awkward meetings for graduation stuff and also realized that my first AP exam was the first one up on Monday that I had not at all prepared for. Considering the way it went, however, I think I can pretty happy with the result. 

Since this is AP week, I think this is the opportunity for me to catch up on all the research I didn't really do over the past few weeks. 

\end{document}
