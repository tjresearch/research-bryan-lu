{"answer": "5", "text": "In the figure above, the circle has center P and radius r. Lines AB and AC are tangent to the circle. If M is the midpoint of segment AC and the measure of angle PMC equals the measure of angle MPC, what is the length, in terms of r, of segment PA?", "key": 1037, "choices": {"1": "r + 1", "2": "2*r", "3": "r*\\sqrt{2}", "4": "r*\\sqrt{3}", "5": "r*\\sqrt{5}"}}
