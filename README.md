# Drawing Geometry Diagrams from Problem Statements

## Overview
The purpose of my project is to write a program that takes an olympiad geometry problem as input and is able to output an Asymptote diagram based on the problem. 

## Requirements
The project is written in Python 3.6, and requires the nltk, codecs, requests, selenium, and bs4 libraries. 

## Installation Instructions
For Webscrape, only download HTML files for use with the scraping programs. Make sure all text files are in the same directory as the code opening them. 

## Run Instructions
Run Python from command line, or through IDE (Pycharm preferred). All files should run without user input.
