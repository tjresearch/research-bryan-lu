I bought the calculator for over $110 2 years ago, and the price hasn't really changed since. A Barclays analyst estimated it cost TI between $15-$20 to manufacture a TI-84+, but it's sold on Amazon for quadruple as much. Amazon itself sells a full-fledged tablet for fifty bucks, which often goes on sale for $40. The TI-84+CE comes with a 0.08 MP screen, a 15 MHz processor, 3 MB of storage, and 154 KB of memory. On the other hand, Amazon's basic fire tablet has a 0.5 MP screen (6X more), a 1.3 GHz processor (85X more), 8 GB of storage (2500X more), and 1 GB of RAM (6000X more). The Fire Tablet also includes Bluetooth, WiFi, cameras and the like. All for less than half the price. By no means is the Amazon Fire Tablet the best tablet out there; it is just a cheap tablet made by a reputable brand whose specs leave the TI-84+CE miles behind. TI gets away with this highway robbery because its calculators are standardized, and classes are much easier to teach when all the students have the same (or similar) calculator. In that sense, TI has a monopoly on graphing calculators and gets to charge what it wants. So, in the end, my calculator works. However, I slashed two stars because I bought cheap tech that is way overpriced. Not worth the money at all, but I didn't really have a choice.
